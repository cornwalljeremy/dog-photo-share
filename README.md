  ### About:
  The is a Photo sharing app. It Is built in React and is hosted on AWS using Amplify. Users can post photos of their dogs. The pictures are stored in an S3 bucket. It uses node to organize the information in the api call to and from the bucket. In Amplify I am using a lambda function. I have setup cloudwatch to monitor the site as well. Lambda automaticallly runs X-ray as well. ### Credits:
